# OpenAI-CarRacing-v0
Mini-project on imitation learning, training an agent to play OpenAI Gym's CarRacing-v0 game.
Final agent is an ensemble of two seperate agents trained on different data. test_ensemble.py is hard-coded to showcase this agent

See https://gym.openai.com/envs/CarRacing-v0/ for more details on the game

After cloning, see "Installation and data collection.txt" in Examples folder for environment setup and data collection commands
Commands for training and testing agent (as well as final agent ensemble) can also be found in the Examples folder.

Finally, intended performance of the agent can be viewed in the video test_ensemble.py 2020-10-06 22-53-06, also found in Examples folder

Shell code was provided by NYU course CSCI.3303-090 Deep Reinforcement Learning, a description of which can be found at:
